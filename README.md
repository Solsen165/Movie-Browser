# Movie Browser
Program for organizing your movie and tv show library

## Features
-  Have all your movies and tv shows accessible from one place
-  All posters and information of your movies and shows are downloaded automatically
-  Keep track of which episodes you have already watched in a show
-  Ability to edit the show's info or poster
-  Ability to search through your library

## How it works
1 - Find all video files in the directories that the user specified

2 - Identify each show's title from the filename

3 - Search IMDB with the show's title and fill the show's information from the first search result

3' - If the file belongs to a tv show, the user can choose to arrange the video files in a seasonal format

4 - If a show is not identified correctly, the user can reidentify it by inputting the correct title or correct IMDB link

## Notes
- The identification process is dependent on IMDB's first search result which may not always be accurate
